Here is a Python program that uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text.
This program uses the caesar_cipher function to perform encryption and decryption. The mode parameter determines whether to encrypt (1) or decrypt (-1). The program also handles non-alphabetical characters by leaving them unchanged.

To use the program, simply run it and follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.
